# Sri-Lankan-Flag-Identifier (ML model)

 Experience Sri Lanka's flag identification magic with our Python Machine Learning model! This project showcases flag detection using a pre-trained AI model. Dive into the code to explore how we've employed image preprocessing, data augmentation, and a binary classification approach to identify whether an input image contains the Sri Lankan flag. Join us in this exploration of image recognition and classification techniques. Developed by Nadeesha Weerasekara. All rights reserved.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python 3.10.10



## Support

I welcome contributions to enhance our model's accuracy and robustness! Support us by providing additional annotated images of Sri Lankan flags to expand our dataset and by suggesting improvements or novel techniques to fine-tune the model. Your collaboration can help us improve flag recognition capabilities and further develop this project.
